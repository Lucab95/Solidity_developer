Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again.

She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

Shrek spots \\n               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a \\n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.

They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them.

She glances at Shrek and Donkey \\n               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes \\n               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along \\n               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \\n               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \\n               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \\n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona \\n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \\n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking \\n               in his sleep.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like \\n                         it like that.

The beer comes rushing out drenching the \\n               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides \\n               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. \\n               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger \\n               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. \\n               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much \\n               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice \\n               to say that Shrek kicks butt.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         Hey, Shrek, tag me!

Give him the chair!\\n\\n               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men \\n               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding \\n               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.\\n \\n                                     SHREK\\n                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you \\n                         very much!

Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again.

She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

The chain links are attached to the chandelier that \\n               is still around the dragons neck.\\n \\n                                     SHREK\\n                         (echoing) Run!\\n\\n               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot \\n               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \\n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \\n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\\n \\n                                     FIONA\\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \\n                         did it!

Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks \\n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. \\n               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \\n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. \\n               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

Shrek spots \\n               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a \\n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.

He throws the sword down in between several overlapping \\n               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that \\n               is still around the dragons neck.\\n \\n                                     SHREK\\n                         (echoing) Run!\\n\\n               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot \\n               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \\n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \\n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\\n \\n                                     FIONA\\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \\n                         did it!

She glances at Shrek and Donkey \\n               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes \\n               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along \\n               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \\n               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \\n               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \\n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona \\n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \\n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking \\n               in his sleep.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like \\n                         it like that.

The beer comes rushing out drenching the \\n               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides \\n               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. \\n               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger \\n               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. \\n               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much \\n               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice \\n               to say that Shrek kicks butt.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         Hey, Shrek, tag me!

Give him the chair!\\n\\n               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men \\n               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding \\n               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.\\n \\n                                     SHREK\\n                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you \\n                         very much!

Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again.

She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \\n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \\n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\\n \\n                                     FIONA\\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \\n                         did it!

Time lapse, Fiona \\n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \\n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona.

The beer comes rushing out drenching the \\n               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides \\n               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. \\n               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger \\n               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. \\n               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much \\n               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice \\n               to say that Shrek kicks butt.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         Hey, Shrek, tag me!

Give him the chair!\\n\\n               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men \\n               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding \\n               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.\\n \\n                                     SHREK\\n                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you \\n                         very much!

Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again.

She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \\n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \\n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\\n \\n                                     FIONA\\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \\n                         did it!

Time lapse, Fiona \\n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \\n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona.

They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side.

The beer comes rushing out drenching the \\n               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides \\n               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. \\n               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger \\n               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. \\n               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much \\n               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice \\n               to say that Shrek kicks butt.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         Hey, Shrek, tag me!

Give him the chair!\\n\\n               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men \\n               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding \\n               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.\\n \\n                                     SHREK\\n                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you \\n                         very much!

Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again.

She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \\n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \\n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\\n \\n                                     FIONA\\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \\n                         did it!

Time lapse, Fiona \\n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \\n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona.
