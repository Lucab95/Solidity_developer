Oh!\\n \\n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \\n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again.

She opens her eyes and \\n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \\n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \\n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \\n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style.

Shrek spots \\n               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a \\n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin.

They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \\n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \\n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \\n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \\n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \\n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \\n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \\n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \\n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\\n \\n                                     FIONA\\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \\n                         did it!

She glances at Shrek and Donkey \\n               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes \\n               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along \\n               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \\n               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \\n               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \\n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona \\n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \\n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking \\n               in his sleep.\\n \\n                                     DONKEY\\n                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like \\n                         it like that.
