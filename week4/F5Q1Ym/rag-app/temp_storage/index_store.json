into the woods and comes \n               across a blue bird.She begins to sing.The bird sings along \n               with her.She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \n               to keep up with her.Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \n               big and the bird explodes.Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oWWpei7BR6cZrOwPuKnQAH4BHIBhAL/cd7Rp7m/8bgs="},"fe173477-27c7-4cb1-a3bb-4832dc4fa339":{"id_":"fe173477-27c7-4cb1-a3bb-4832dc4fa339","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"7e6ec159-6a57-4bd4-9462-a6744c99496e","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"hash":"tOxbDoMVffmA2nsiYgmy8CR0t0zoSdL+NgSYdFPwX7Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c9ca6d6a-0d0d-4b7c-97a9-5fa3cf162e15","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"hash":"V+CqzZSdnXFR3lPQYE0iJlYgiFYrxxD65ailk4mHMZs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7613ab7f-60e9-480b-b16d-288f36486da3","metadata":{},"hash":"UEels3osnmQj6p5s3M/jBanuBKTe7FfWbtjkEhViND0="}},"text":"Time

into the woods and comes \n               across a blue bird.She begins to sing.The bird sings along \n               with her.She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \n               to keep up with her.Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \n               big and the bird explodes.Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oWWpei7BR6cZrOwPuKnQAH4BHIBhAL/cd7Rp7m/8bgs="},"023e3922-b0eb-4138-8b17-2f85b1b08e73":{"id_":"023e3922-b0eb-4138-8b17-2f85b1b08e73","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ea193329-c73d-43d3-aa56-a1fc23579d22","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"hash":"tOxbDoMVffmA2nsiYgmy8CR0t0zoSdL+NgSYdFPwX7Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"972f2563-9e14-4a8a-bcd7-eba660047418","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"hash":"V+CqzZSdnXFR3lPQYE0iJlYgiFYrxxD65ailk4mHMZs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"47977978-0c4b-4ae5-a8fb-5384173ecc2e","metadata":{},"hash":"UEels3osnmQj6p5s3M/jBanuBKTe7FfWbtjkEhViND0="}},"text":"Time

to keep up with her.Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \n               big and the bird explodes.Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"oWWpei7BR6cZrOwPuKnQAH4BHIBhAL/cd7Rp7m/8bgs="},"41e2c3b8-42dc-472b-96ea-650687ae74d5":{"id_":"41e2c3b8-42dc-472b-96ea-650687ae74d5","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"5ed0f758-361d-46da-8ac8-f031fa138cb8","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"hash":"tOxbDoMVffmA2nsiYgmy8CR0t0zoSdL+NgSYdFPwX7Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8fa978c9-0cc9-4733-ab9b-2146f2858721","metadata":{"file_name":"Shrek.txt","private":"true"},"hash":"V+CqzZSdnXFR3lPQYE0iJlYgiFYrxxD65ailk4mHMZs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"35e9fa5b-4a1a-401a-8f07-d410c0eb28ad","metadata":{},"hash":"UEels3osnmQj6p5s3M/jBanuBKTe7FfWbtjkEhViND0="}},"text":"Time
