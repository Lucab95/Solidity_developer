# Overview
This is the project of kvutien (KshMR4) homework of week 4 of the Encode Club AI Agent bootcamp, Q1 2025. 
- the LlamaIndex demo `rag-app` is installed in `KsHRM4-week4week4`

## Homework Assignment
The homework tasks are:
1. Design a page with a single input field for `.txt` file uploads.
2.	Users should upload a book or similar content about a theatre with characters and settings.
3.	Implement a button to extract characters from the uploaded file.
4.	Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file.
5.	Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format.
(optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use Structured Outputs to make it easier to process the response.
6.	Each character should have a name, description, and personality.
7.	Add a text area below the button to display the results.
8.	Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI.

- in this demo app,  I managed to upload the shrek.txt file but when submitting a prompt to the AI, I hit an error
``` bash
llamaindex was already imported. This breaks constructor checks and will lead to issues!
Using 'openai' model provider
The data stream is hanging. Did you forget to close it with `data.close()`?
```
Encode Club told me that I can ignore the message. The app stioll works. This is true indeed. So I continue...

## Getting Started

In the exercise 1 of lesson 16, we have already done most of the home work.
1.	Design a page with a single input field for .txt file uploads.
2.	Users should upload a book or similar content.
3.	Implement a button to Extract Characters.
4.	The button will call an AI-powered function that implements a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the text in the uploaded file.
5.	Each character should have a name, description, and personality.

The real work remaining to do is in the following:
0.	Adapt the look-and-feel to Machu Picchu.
1.	Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format.
2.	(optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use `Structured Outputs` to make it easier to process the response.
3.	Each character should have a name, description, and personality.
4.	Add a text area below the button to display the results.
5.	Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI.

The rest is WiP. All text below are placeholders.
