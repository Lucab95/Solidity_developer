Ah, Brazilian pork! One popular dish is **Feijoada**, a traditional Brazilian stew made with black beans and various cuts of pork. It's hearty and full of flavor. Here’s a detailed recipe for you:

### Feijoada (Brazilian Black Bean Stew)

#### Ingredients:
- **For the Feijoada:**
  - 1 pound (450g) black beans (dried)
  - 1 pound (450g) pork shoulder (cut into chunks)
  - 1/2 pound (225g) smoked sausage (such as linguiça or chorizo, sliced)
  - 1/2 pound (225g) kielbasa or any other smoked sausage
  - 1/2 pound (225g) bacon (cut into pieces)
  - 1 onion (chopped)
  - 4 cloves garlic (minced)
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 2-3 cups chicken broth (or water, as needed)
  - Salt and black pepper to taste
  - Orange slices (for garnish)
  - Chopped fresh cilantro (for garnish)

- **For the Accompaniments:**
  - Cooked white rice
  - Sautéed collard greens (or kale)
  - Farofa (toasted cassava flour) or cornmeal
  - Sliced oranges
  
#### Instructions:

1. **Soak the Beans:**
   - Rinse the black beans under cold water and soak them in a large bowl with water for at least 8 hours or overnight (this helps them cook evenly).

2. **Cook the Meats:**
   - In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, add the bacon and cook until crispy. Remove and set aside, leaving some fat in the pot.
   - In the bacon fat, add the pork shoulder chunks and brown them on all sides. Remove and set aside.
   - In the same pot, add the sausages (both types) and cook until lightly browned. Then, add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté until the onion is softened and translucent.

3. **Combine and Simmer:**
   - Return the bacon, browned pork, and sausage to the pot with the onion and garlic. Drain the soaked beans and add them to the pot.
   - Pour in enough chicken broth to cover the ingredients by about 1 inch. Add the bay leaves and season with salt and black pepper.
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it cook gently for about 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Ensure it doesn't dry out; add more broth or water as necessary.

4. **Final Seasoning:**
   - After the cooking time, taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed. If the stew is too thick, you can add a bit more broth or water.

5. **Serve:**
   - Remove the bay leaves before serving. Serve the feijoada hot, garnished with orange slices and chopped cilantro. 

6. **Accompaniments:**
   - Serve the feijoada with cooked white rice, sautéed collard greens, and farofa. Don't forget to place some fresh orange slices on the side for a delightful contrast!

### Tips:
- You can customize your feijoada by adding other meats like beef or lamb, depending on your preferences.
- Traditional feijoada is often better the next day as the flavors meld together. Feel free to make it a day in advance!
- If you want a quicker version, you can use canned black beans (drained), but soaking and cooking dried beans gives the best flavor and texture.
