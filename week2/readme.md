## week 2

1. I did the exercises of lesson 5 and 6.
2. I found that in the exercise 3 of lesson 6, the UI of Vercel has changed significantly from the lesson instructions: I had to "Add Product" that is Upstash for Redis. I have to give the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY which I know, but the AUTH_SECRET value I discovered how to obtain it when reading the file .env.example of the nextjs.chat github.
3. I could deploy the nextjs-chat app on vercel but the homepage requests a login and I don't know what login it is. I tried the AUTH_SECRET ket but this doesn't work. And I don't feel like giving my credential on a web page powered by a set of libraries that I don't know.
